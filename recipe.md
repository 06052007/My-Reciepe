Gather your ingredients.
Beat the eggs with a whisk until the yolks and whites are completely combined. Season the eggs with salt and pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl the olive oil to completely coat the pan. Then turn the heat down to low.
Add the eggs to the pan, swirling quickly to cover the bottom. Adjust the heat if needed so that the bottom doesn't brown too quickly.
Use a rubber spatula to move the eggs from the edge to the center, exposing parts of the pan so that the egg can completely cook. Then leave the eggs undisturbed and allow them to cook until the omelet is almost set.
When the omelet is almost set, spoon the warmed tomato sauce over half of it. Cover the tomato sauce with the shredded cheese. Cook for 30 seconds, until the bottom is just about to brown.
Fold the omelet in half. Cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the cheese is melted and everything is heated through.
Serve with a little chopped basil or parsley if you wish and dig in!
